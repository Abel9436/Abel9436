👋 Hi, I'm Abel Bekele, an App Developer with a passion for the Flutter framework and a Backend Developer specializing in the Django framework.

👀 I'm deeply interested in crafting problem-solving solutions that work seamlessly across various platforms using Flutter. I'm also dedicated to developing flexible and robust backends that enhance the overall UI/UX experience.

🌱 Currently, I'm on an exciting journey of learning and constantly improving my skills. I'm diving into advanced aspects of Flutter, mastering REST API integration, exploring the world of Firebase, and delving into the intriguing field of Machine Learning.

💞️ I'm actively seeking collaborations on projects that align with my expertise and interests. Let's team up to create something amazing!
